## 1. Break It Down! 📝

- Make a simple to-do list (and enjoy crossing things off!)
- Take breaks between tasks (your brain needs them!)

## 2. Study Smarter, Not Harder! 📚
- Find your best study time (morning person or night owl?)
- Create a cool study playlist
- Try the "Pomodoro Technique" (25 mins study, 5 mins break)

## 3. Don't Forget the Fun! 🎮
- Plan something fun after studying
- Hang out with friends on weekends
- Keep doing your favorite hobbies

## 4. Talk About It! 🗣️
- Tell your teachers if you're struggling
- Chat with friends (they probably feel the same!)
- Talk to your parents or school counselor

Remember: You're doing great! School is just one part of life - not everything has to be perfect! 💪
